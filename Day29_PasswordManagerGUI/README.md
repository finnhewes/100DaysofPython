Very simple, lightweight, and offline password manager, with a random password generate button, a search feature, and a sick custom logo. 
Edit the code to include your personal email (Line 141), to make your life a lot easier! 
I didn't include this as a function in the program, because in theory, there will only ever be one user using this, and if you're downloading this from GitHub, you can probably figure out the edit mentioned above.
Feel free to use this as you like, to keep your passwords safe and offline! I guess you can change the logo if you don't like my branding... I won't be offended... sniff sniff
