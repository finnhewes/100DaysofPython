Classic bare-bones etch-a-sketch program. Control your cursor with the "aswd" keys. 
"W" to move forward, "S" to move backwards, "A" to rotate left, and "D" to rotate right.
You can clear the screen/drawing pad by pressing "C", and start a fresh drawing without having to restart the program. 
Enjoy! Send me a screenshot of the masterpieces you create! :)
