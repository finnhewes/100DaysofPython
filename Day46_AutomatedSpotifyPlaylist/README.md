This project scrapes the web for the Billboard Top 100 for whichever date the user inputs, and creates a Spotify playlist out of any/all available songs from the generated Top 100 list.
It seems like you can input any date within the last 25 years, maybe more, and listen to the hottest tracks of the time. 
I added my Spotify credentials as env variables, so you dirty bastards can't steal any of the juicy details of my free Spotify account, so you'll have to input your own credentials for this code to work. I've linked to the Spotify for Developers page in a comment in line 9 of my code. It's totally free to use.
Lastly, my program adds a lot of karaoke versions of songs to my playlists, but as some songs are not available at all, I figured I would leave the karaoke versions in, so we can stick to as close to a 100 song length as humanly possible. Plus, you'll probably want to sing along anyway. 
Try it out for yourself! Have fun!
