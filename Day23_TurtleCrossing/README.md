This is a bare-bones classic Frogger game, with a Turtle as a main character instead of the Frogger frog. Created using an object oriented approach. 
The cars are randomly generated, and will increase in speed each time you cross successfully, so you better be quick!
Control our turtle using the directional keys, and try not to get smushed!
