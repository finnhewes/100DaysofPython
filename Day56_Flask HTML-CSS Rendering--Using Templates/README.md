This is a simple "e-business card" site that I made using the Flask framework, and importing a premade template from HTML5UP.net.

The social media buttons don't work, because I don't have those social media platforms. I didn't feel like swapping out the logos and hrefs for this little potato site, but thought I would post it as an archive of my having begun working with Flask.
I'm moving on to make larger projects with Flask next, and will put my time to better use there, I think.
